Metco increases the number of blacks and reduces test scores in receiving districts. School-level data for Massachusetts and micro data from a large district show no impact of Metco on the scores of white non-Metco students. But the micro estimates show some evidence of an effect on minority third graders, especially girls. Instrumental variables estimates for third graders are imprecise but generally in line with ordinary least squares estimates. Given the localized nature of these results, we conclude that peer effects from Metco are modest and short lived.},

This research note shows the results from a first stage of a wider research project on meritocracy and distributive preferences in Chile, which is based on 9 interviews with social science scholars whose research is related to these issues. Findings show that researchers refer to merit and meritocracy not only departing from different definitions but also giving them contentious social relevance. Furthermore, effort takes precedence over talent, a more developed dimension in international research. The results are discussed taking the Chilean socio-cultural context into account, characterized by rapid neoliberal modernization as well as high economic inequality.},

Parental choice and school competition are seen as ways of achieving reform and raising standards while at the same time reducing State intervention into education planning. This paper interrogates the arguments made for markets and against public monopoly schooling; and it is argued that on both counts the claims of advocates are partial and flawed. The failure to address the bases and effects of inequalities of the market are given particular attention. It is argued that markets in education provide the possibility for the pursuit of class advantage and generate a differentiated and stratified system of schooling. 1I am indebted to my colleagues Sharon Gewirtz, Richard Bowe and Alan Cribb, and Barry Troyna, Manfred Weiss and two referees for their contributions to the arguments in this paper. The paper also benefited from ongoing discussions with Richard Bowe and Sharon Gewirtz related to two research projects; one funded by the Strategic Research Fund of King's College; the other funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, Grant No. 232858.},

We then review the research that has tried to quantify the relevance of these factors in explaining gender differences in labor market outcomes outside of the laboratory setting. We also describe recent research on the relationship between social and gender identity norms and women's labor market choices and outcomes, as well as on the role of child-rearing practices in explaining gender identity norms. Finally, we report on some recent work documenting puzzling trends in women's well-being and discuss possible explanations for these trends, including identity considerations. We conclude with suggestions for future research.},

Su relevancia tem\'atica radica en los efectos en la integraci\'on social, consecuencia de la exclusi\'on social de las minor\'ias en el contexto escolar. Metodol\'ogicamente, es un trabajo descriptivo-correlacional, que explica las interrelaciones existentes entre los factores educativos y sociales, que permite comprender la din\'amica escolar de los estudiantes migrantes y locales.A trav\'es de un enfoque mixto, los resultados muestran la compleja red de representaciones sociales y escolares asociadas con la migraci\'on y la permanencia en el sistema escolar formal, as\'i como las dificultades de inclusi\'on de los colectivos migrantes en las din\'amicas cotidianas de juego y trabajo en espacios escolares. Estas est\'an relacionadas con la concentraci\'on de estudiantes migrantes en las aulas, su g\'enero y el colectivo espec\'ifico al que pertenecen. El estudio tambi\'en muestra que las instituciones escolares no tienen pol\'iticas espec\'ificas que organicen y estructuren lo que, muchas de ellas, intentan hacer en respuesta a la inclusi\'on de la educaci\'on migratoria y a la interacci\'on de colaboraci\'on entre los diferentes actores en el aula y las escuelas.},

Pese a las constantes referencias a la meritocracia en la investigaci\'on de desigualdad y estratificaci\'on social en sociolog\'ia, existen pocos intentos conceptuales y emp\'iricos que busquen entender hasta qu\'e punto los individuos perciben y prefieren la meritocracia, as\'i como tambi\'en sus consecuencias. La presente investigaci\'on propone un marco conceptual y emp\'irico para el estudio de las percepciones y preferencias meritocr\'aticas que, posteriormente, es relacionado con una serie de variables relativas a la desigualdad social. Utilizando datos de la encuesta chilena ``Justicia social y participaci\'on ciudadana'' (N= 1.245), los resultados del an\'alisis sugieren que las preferencias y percepciones de la meritocracia son constructos distintos y que quienes perciben un adecuado funcionamiento de la meritocracia tambi\'en perciben menos desigualdad social.},

We will use the cross-national Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2006 data for native students and students with an immigrant background, in which both cohorts are 15 years old. A greater ethnic diversity of school populations in secondary education hampers the educational performance of students with an immigrant background but does not significantly affect that of native students. The sociocultural diversity of schools has no effect on educational performance. However, the level of the curriculum attended by the students and the average parental sociocultural status of schools are important variables that explain the educational performance of children. A higher share of students of non-Islamic Asian origin in a school increases the educational performance of both native and immigrant students of other origins in that school. Students from non-Islamic Asian countries in schools with higher shares of students of non-Islamic Asian origin perform better than do comparable students originating from other regions. Students originating from Islamic countries have substantially lower language scores than do equivalent students with an immigrant background from other regions. This cannot be explained by individual socioeconomic backgrounds, school characteristics, or educational systems. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

In other words, in integrated school systems, a pupil's school achievement depends less than elsewhere on the social and cultural resources of his or her family. However, before concluding that school structure has a significant influence on inequalities at school, it is important to distinguish between the influence of the socio-economic context underlying each school system, and the specific influence of the structure or organisation of the school system itself. The fact is that not only do the most egalitarian countries with regard to schooling have in common an integrated structure, but also these schools are set within the context of countries which are more egalitarian in other ways, particularly with regard to income distribution. To distinguish between the influence of this social environment and that of school structure, the authors offer three analyses based on a comparative analysis of international databases measuring educational achievement. The results of these three analyses lend credence to the hypothesis that the structure of the school system has a specific effect on the extent of inequalities.},

Researchers have found that Chile's voucher program has lead to increased socioeconomic school segregation. What has been overlooked, however, is segregation between schools within a sector and variation within private for-profit and non-profit school sectors. I find that public schools are more likely to serve disadvantaged students than private voucher schools. I also find that disadvantaged students are more segregated among private voucher schools than among public schools. While between and within sector segregation levels vary across private voucher school types, the differences are not always consistent with theory. The data also suggest that policies can either mitigate or exacerbate the stratifying effects of educational vouchers.},

If having more advantaged peers is beneficial, then these trends may reduce educational equity. Previous studies have outlined individual or groups of theories about how peers influence one another, but these theories have rarely been subjected to empirical tests. Focus of Study: This study provides a description of a wide range of peer influence theories from psychologists, sociologists, and economists. A taxonomy is developed that distinguishes theories based primarily on whether students are hypothesized to change each other's beliefs and values (direct influences) versus more indirect influences, such as the allocation of teachers and school resources. Whether empirical evidence, including important new advancements by economists, informs the validity of the various theories is then considered. Although far from definitive, the study highlights the importance of carrying out empirical analysis that tests specific theories. Research Design: Quantitative researchers are increasingly aware of the great difficulty of determining whether correlations between individual and group outcomes reflect a causal effect of peers. The review of empirical evidence focuses on experimental and quasi-experimental studies, which most plausibly reflect causal influences. These studies focus on student achievement as the outcome of interest. Conclusions: The evidence is not completely consistent with any single theory, though it is more supportive of some over others. A new hybrid theory - group-based contagion - is proposed that is more consistent with the evidence.},

  abstract = {Peer effects are potentially important for understanding the optimal organization of schools, jobs, and neighborhoods, but finding evidence is difficult because people are selected into peer groups based, in part, on their unobservable characteristics. I identify the effects of peers whom a child encounters in the classroom using sources of variation that are credibly idiosyncratic, such as changes in the gender and racial composition of a grade in a school in adjacent years. I use specification tests, including one based on randomizing the order of years, to confirm that the variation I use is not generated by time trends or other non-idiosyncratic forces. I find that students are affected by the achievement level of their peers: a credibly exogenous change of 1 point in peers' reading scores raises a student's own score between 0.15 and 0.4 points, depending on the specification. Although I find little evidence that peer effects are generally non-linear, I do find that peer effects are stronger intra-race and that some effects do not operate through peers' achievement. For instance, both males and females perform better in math in classrooms that are more female despite the fact that females' math performance is about the same as that of males.},

  abstract = {In 1981, Chile introduced nationwide school choice by providing vouchers to any student wishing to attend private school. As a result, more than 1000 private schools entered the market, and the private enrollment rate increased by 20 percentage points, with greater impacts in larger, more urban, and wealthier communities. We use this differential impact to measure the effects of unrestricted choice on educational outcomes. Using panel data for about 150 municipalities, we find no evidence that choice improved average educational outcomes as measured by test scores, repetition rates, and years of schooling. However, we find evidence that the voucher program led to increased sorting, as the ``best'' public school students left for the private sector.},

We also describe recent research on the relationship between social and gender identity norms and women's labor market choices and outcomes, as well as on the role of child-rearing practices in explaining gender identity norms. Finally, we report on some recent work documenting puzzling trends in women's well-being and discuss possible explanations for these trends, including identity considerations.

A decomposition of achievement regressions that include classroom fixed effects suggests that 50\%-70\% of the difference is attributable to differences in schools and classrooms that are attended by indigenous and nonindigenous students. A smaller proportion (20\%-40\%) is attributable to varying endowments of family variables like parental education. The smallest proportion of the gap (10\%-20\%) is unexplained.

  abstract = {Is the political support for welfare policy higher or lower in less egalitarian societies? We answer the question using a model of welfare policy as publicly financed insurance that pays benefits in a redistributive manner. When voters have both redistributive and insurance motives for supporting welfare spending, the effect of inequality depends on how benefits are targeted. Greater inequality increases support for welfare expenditures when benefits are targeted to the employed but decreases support when benefits are targeted to those without earnings. With endogenous targeting, support for benefits to those without earnings declines as inequality increases, whereas support for aggregate spending is a V-shaped function of inequality. Statistical analysis of welfare expenditures in advanced industrial societies provides support for key empirical implications of the model.},

In contrast to the previous literature that has studied the effect of single-sex schools, the advantage of using single-sex classrooms is that we can calculate gender gaps within schools, and therefore the results are not confounded with other school characteristics that may correlate with the gender composition. We find that single-sex classrooms reduce the math gender gap by more than half, with no effect on the language gender gap. The effect is consistent with an increase in the math achievement of female students with no decrease in the achievement of male students. Moreover, this effect is not driven by teacher characteristics, but it seems to be driven by the gender composition of the classroom itself.},

Results were similar for all subjects except social studies, for which there was a trend favoring heterogeneous placement. Results were close to zero for students of all levels of prior performance.

Developing an analytical review of international research in this area, this chapter begins by discussing conceptual and methodological problems related to theorising school compositional effects. A model is developed through which the adequacy of existing studies for capturing compositional effects can be judged. This model helps to explain why existing studies have failed to reach consensus since the modelling techniques vary and none approach the adequacy criteria articulated in the model. Qualitative research can go a long way towards illuminating the subtle processes that are likely to underlie school compositional effects. The inherent difficulties in ``measuring'' elements of compositional effects have left debate around the importance of school compositional effects open to political and ideological considerations, since the outcomes of key policy decisions such as school choice, effectiveness, and accountability depend on the findings.},

It uses data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study. The results show that in Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, teacher practices and attitudes relate to the civic outcomes. Although teachers' practices and attitudes significantly predict students' civic knowledge, this relationship does not seem relevant for students' expected participation and students' attitudes toward diversity. Still, the democratic environment of the school is a relevant variable in the case of expected participation of students and their attitudes toward diversity, which shows a possible indirect influence of teachers through the school environment. The results are discussed in relation to the civic education curriculum in place in the countries analyzed.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the segregation within schools in Chile, looking at the related institutional factors and the effect that this process has on students' academic performance. To analyze the relationship between institutional factors and within-school segregation, it uses a logistic regression, controlling for a set of school characteristics. This analysis finds that within-school segregation is related to institutional factors such as school size and the characteristics of their students. To determine the effects of within-school segregation on academic performance, a multilevel regression model is used, organized in three levels: school, classroom and student. The results show that within-school segregation has negative consequences on educational quality, efficiency and equity, since internal segregation reduces the average educational outcomes of the schools and mostly affects students of middle groups within the school in both academic achievement and socioeconomic terms.},

Data from the Longitudinaal Onderzoek Secundair Onderwijs project are used. Multilevel analyses were carried out on a sample of approximately 4000 pupils, 330 classes (190 single-sex), 180 teachers and 50 schools (20 single-sex). The results indicate that for boys the gender composition of the classes has more impact than the gender composition of die schools, whereas for girls the gender composition of the schools is more important. Boys make more progress for language (and not for mathematics) in co-educational classes even after we have taken into account the selective nature of the classes. Girls, on the other hand, make more progress for mathematics (but not for language) in single-sex than in co-educational schools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Changing labour markets, increased calls for selection and excellence, and increased diversity and individualisation have repercussions on how educational systems can prepare youth for work, optimise knowledge production, achieve equality of opportunity, and socialise students into active civic engagement. This paper discusses four central tasks of schooling and examines to what extent societal developments challenge education policy to deliver on the tasks at hand. Particular attention is given to the challenges Europe's strongly diversified educational systems are currently facing. Both the Netherlands and Germany, for example, have been offering vocationally-oriented pathways alongside traditional academic higher education for some time. But today's ongoing changes in job descriptions, mainly due to ever-accelerating technological developments, are causing a risk of skills obsolescence which can only be avoided by continuous upskilling and/or reskilling of a sufficiently flexible workforce. Overcoming differences of intelligence as well as differences of diverse socioeconomic, ethnic and linguistic backgrounds by way of education is another challenge, as is fostering ``soft'' skills and political awareness. This paper investigates the effectiveness of current education systems in preparing citizens for a functioning modern society.},

  abstract = {Previous studies on the effects on students' test scores of their peers' socioeconomic status (SES) have reported varying results. In order to understand why researchers have alternately found small effects, large effects, or no effects at all, a meta-regression analysis including an extensive database of 30 studies on the topic was conducted. Results show that the size of the compositional effect that researchers find is strongly related to how they measure SES and to their choice of model. Measuring SES dichotomously (e.g. free lunch eligibility) or including several average SES variables in one model leads to smaller effect estimates than using a thoroughly constructed composite that includes several of the dimensions of SES. Composition measured at cohort/school level is associated with smaller effects than composition measured at class level. Researchers estimating the compositional effect without controlling in their model for prior achievement or not taking into account the potential for omitted variables bias, risk overestimating the effect. On the other hand, including in a model a large set of covariates that are not well thought-over may lead to an underestimation of the compositional effect, since it artificially explains away the effect. Little evidence was found that effect sizes differ with sample characteristics such as test type (language vs. math) and country. Estimates for a hypothetical study, making a number of ``ideal'' choices, suggest that peer SES is an important determinant of academic achievement.},

We used data from 1324 immigrant and 10,546 native students gathered in the school year 2004-2005 in a sample of 85 Flemish (Belgian) secondary schools. Logistic multilevel analyses (HLM6) show that students attending schools with a majority of native students (enrolling less than 20\% immigrant students) were twice as likely to plan to finish high school and to plan for higher education than those attending high concentration schools (more than 50\% immigrant students). These associations were due to students' socio-economic status (SES) and there was no difference in aspirations between high and low concentration schools after controlling for students' SES and the SES context of the school. All else being equal, immigrant students in high concentration schools tended to aspire to finish high school and move on to higher education slightly more than those attending medium concentration schools (20-50\% immigrant students). The analyses further show that these differences between high and medium concentration schools can be explained by the more optimistic culture in high concentration schools. The main conclusion is that high concentration schools are not necessarily detrimental for students' educational aspirations.},

  abstract = {Background/Context: Many children of immigrants are not enrolled in high schools that sufficiently meet their needs, and subsequently, many are not making a successful transition to, and/or successfully completing, higher education. As immigration grows in the United States, educators and policy makers must understand how the educational processes for chil dren of immigrants differ from nonimmigrants. Because expectations for higher education are a necessary, though insufficient, step toward college attendance and degree attainment, and because students have these attitudes influenced by the schools they attend, I examine high school composition for its effects on educational expectations and how compositional effects differ between children of immigrants and nonimmigrants. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study intends to be another step on the path toward understanding the educational processes of children of immigrants specifically, and of all students more broadly, as the immigrant population grows in U.S. schools. Toward those ends, this study is based on two overarching research questions: (1) How do the immigrant compositions of U.S. secondary schools affect the educational expec tations of all students? (2) How do the compositions of U.S. secondary schools affect the edu cational expectations of children of immigrants differently than nonimmigrant students? Research Design: The research questions are addressed via secondary data analysis using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS:2002/2004), which were collected by the National Center for Education Statistics. I explore school composition effects on a binary dependent variable indicating whether a 12th-grade student expects to complete a graduate or professional degree. This study emphasizes a critical-quantitative approach by demon strating that common theories and assumptions about educational expectations may be inac curate for children of immigrants in today's schools. Conclusions/Recommendations: Results show that children of immigrants are affected dif ferently by school composition than are nonimmigrants, and in ways that contradict},
